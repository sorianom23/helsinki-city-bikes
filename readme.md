## Helsinki City Bikes

Data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/geometrein/helsinki-city-bikes

The Helsinki City Bikes have become an increasingly popular mode of transportation for citizens of Helsinki and Espoo, with more than 10 million trips taken between 2016 and 2020. As the city bike system continues to expand and evolve, it is important to gain insights into the usage patterns and trends of the bikes. In this data analysis project, I will explore the Helsinki City Bike dataset to uncover valuable insights about how citizens are using the bikes, when and where they are most frequently used, and how usage patterns have changed over time. By analyzing this data, I aim to gain a deeper understanding of the impact of the Helsinki City Bikes on the community and inform future decisions regarding the system's expansion and operation.
